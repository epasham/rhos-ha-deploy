# this is the common to all VMs/clusters!

# to be executed on ALL nodes of a given cluster:

# install the packages
yum install -y pcs pacemaker corosync fence-agents-all resource-agents

# enable pcsd
systemctl enable pcsd
systemctl start pcsd

# set a password for hacluster user. password should be the same on all nodes
passwd hacluster

# I SET THE PASSWORD TO: cluster
# use a safer one

# autheticate nodes (example from rhos5-lb cluster)
# the -p option is used to give the password on command line and make it easier to script
# this is the same passwd you set few lines above
# let see how many are going to ask about it
# cause you know.. i write notes for fun :)

pcs cluster auth rhos5-lb1 rhos5-lb2 rhos5-lb3 -u hacluster -p cluster --force

# FROM THIS POINT ON YOU CAN EXECUTE PCS COMMANDS ON ONE SINGLE NODE!

pcs cluster setup --name rhos5-lb rhos5-lb1 rhos5-lb2 rhos5-lb3
pcs cluster enable --all
pcs cluster start --all

# WAIT FOR CLUSTER TO SETTLE DOWN!
